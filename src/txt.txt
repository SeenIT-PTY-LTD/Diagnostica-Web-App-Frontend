It seems like you're encountering an issue where a specific path, `http://3.27.228.188/patient`, which is a frontend path, is being treated as a GET request by the server, resulting in a 404 (Not Found) error. Typically, this occurs because the server doesn't have a specific route or resource corresponding to that path.

To avoid this confusion, you can consider a few approaches:

1. **Server Configuration:** Adjust the server configuration to handle such paths differently. For instance, you might set up a rule to ignore or handle these paths separately from regular GET requests.

2. **Client-side Routing:** If this path is only relevant within the frontend (for client-side routing), you can handle it without making an actual server request. Libraries like React Router, Vue Router, or Angular's router can manage these paths internally without contacting the server.

3. **Mock Responses:** If the path is for UI purposes and doesn't correspond to any backend functionality, consider mocking a response on the server to avoid the 404 error. This response can be a placeholder or empty response solely for frontend routing purposes.

Can you provide more details about your server configuration or how the frontend and backend are structured? That might help in providing more specific guidance.
